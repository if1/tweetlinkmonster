  Tweet Link Monster gives you an Atom feed of all of the links people you follow tweet. That way if you either don't want to or can't (perhaps because you're getting them via SMS) look at websites while reading tweets, you will be able to go back and see all of those websites.

  TLM is now officially at a super-extra-alpha release. The monster's not born yet, aesthetics don't exist, but it works.

  I've fixed a lot of bugs recently. Sorry for any inconvenience from having the site in somewhat-to-fully broken states occasionally. It (hopefully) will be a lot more stable from now on.

  Go

  Your feed will be http://www.tweetlinkmonster.com/feed/username.xml (though this might change too)
